# This file is derived from the github actions cppcmake file provided by SCCN.
# Modifications were made to compile for MinGW
# Modifications are annotated with comments.
#
# Strategy for following upstream (sccn) development: We apply the
# modifications that we did for this release to their next release,
# while resolving any conflicts that may arise.  We will tag our
# modifications with a tag that is the same as their release tag with
# "-htch" or similar appended.  Sccn's main branch is named "master",
# we name our main branch "main" as long as there is no name conflict.
# For each new release that we follow, we will replace our existing
# branch "main" with a new branch "main" by force-pushing.  Old
# releases can still be accessed later through their "-htch" tags.
# Any changes done by upstream in the github actions file cppcmake.yml should
# also be applied to our additional github actions files mingw.yml and arm.yml.
#
# In practive, roughly follow these steps when sccn publish a new release:
#
# Inside our repository, on branch "main":
# git diff <last_upstream_release_tag> >/tmp/diff.diff
# git fetch git@github.com:sccn/liblsl
# git fetch --tags git@github.com:sccn/liblsl
# git checkout <new_upstram_release_tag>
# git apply --index /tmp/diff.diff # Fix any conflicts before proceeding
# git diff <last_upstream_release_tag> <new_upstram_release_tag> -- .github/workflows/cppcmake.yml >/tmp/diff2
# patch .github/workflows/arm.yml </tmp/diff2 # Fix any conflicts before proceeding
# patch .github/workflows/mingw.yml </tmp/diff2 # Fix any conflicts before proceeding
# git commit -m "Add our build files"
# git tag <new_upstream_release_tag>-htch # to find our modified release later
# git checkout main
# git reset --hard <new_upstream_release_tag>-htch # history modification!
# git push --force
# git push origin <new_upstram_release_tag>
# git push origin <new_upstream_release_tag>-htch
